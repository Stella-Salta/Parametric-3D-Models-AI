# PromptMorph Workflow Case Studies
This repository contains materials related to the PromptMorph Workflow, a research framework exploring the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs), Python, and Grasshopper to automate 3D parametric modeling in architecture.

# About PromptMorph
PromptMorph is an exploratory methodology that bridges text and image prompts with computational tools like Python and Grasshopper. It aims to empower architects and designers to generate parametric geometries without requiring extensive coding expertise. The workflow demonstrates how LLMs can create editable and dynamic parametric models, reducing manual effort and enabling iterative design exploration.

The research is authored by Styliani (Stella) Salta and Miltiadis Katsaros from the National Technical University of Athens, School of Architecture.

# Key Contributions
Text-to-3D Modeling: Automating the generation of parametric geometries using Python and Grasshopper based on natural language or image inputs.
Prompt Engineering: Introducing novel techniques, including image-based prompting, to translate complex design intents into executable scripts.
Iterative Refinement: Addressing debugging and adjustments through iterative interactions between ChatGPT and Grasshopper.
